1. Combine all year data of 1200 crytocurrency

2. Static index, plot

3. Set up the window of choosing Nc(Number of coins include in the index)
Tn = 90, but updating every 30 days, set as Tn_gap
4. Set up the window of choosing a_base(the base index for the window period)
Tw = 30

5. Write the calculation process for the first 90 days data for test

6. Write the function to calculate the NC for each windows.
Nc_cal function

7. Write the function to calculate the actual index value for each windows.
dynamic_index_base function

6. Use for loop to calculate the Nc for each windows, saved in NC_list.
